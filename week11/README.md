# Assignment

1. Plot a heatmap of the methylation levels of the genes in top 5 DMR regions.
  - hint: use `getMeth(..., regions=...)` and for the heatmap you can adapt the code we used for the promoters.    
    
    
2. Run an enrichment analysis (rGREAT) of the genes within DMRs (see [./data_practical/dmr.rds](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/ethEpigen2023_materials/tree/main/week11/w11_practical)) vs all genes of chromosome 22.   
  - Describe what your enrichment analysis is testing exactly & describe the results.   
    
Save your assignment in a R markdown named assignment.Rmd, render it, and push the html file to this folder in your github repository
